When you think about entitlement it most likely applies to narcissistic people who believe that they should be treated as special. When they aren't, their reactions can be swift and harsh. Although an expectation of being treated with dignity and respect is part of the general human condition, the narcissistic type of entitlement becomes part of a total picture of pathology. Perhaps you were recently with a relative who is not exactly your favorite person. You both were invited to a birthday celebration for someone who is not your family member but is related to this other person. Your sense of what's appropriate led you to buy a fairly nice gift along with a card that expressed the friendship and admiration you have for the recipient. You also chipped in a side dish to contribute to the day's festivities. Much to your surprise, the actual relative showed up with nothing. In fact, they asked if they could bring some of the leftovers home. In retrospect, you shouldn't have been surprised because this was pretty typical behavior.
